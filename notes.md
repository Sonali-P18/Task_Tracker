# Design Decisions & Notes

## Database Design
- Used MongoDB for flexibility in task structure
- Simple schema with appropriate field types
- Added indexes on frequently queried fields (status, priority, due_date)
- Included timestamps for auditing

## API Design
- RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods
- Input validation and error handling
- Consistent response format
- CORS enabled for frontend integration

## Frontend Architecture
- Component-based React architecture
- State management with hooks
- Responsive CSS Grid layout
- Real-time updates after mutations

## Smart Insights Logic
- Rule-based summary generation
- Priority and status analysis
- Due date calculations
- Natural language formatting

## Improvements for Production
1. Add user authentication (JWT)
2. Implement pagination for large task lists
3. Add unit and integration tests
4. Add rate limiting
5. Implement proper error logging
6. Add task categories/tags
7. Implement task dependencies
8. Add file attachments
9. Implement real-time updates with WebSockets
10. Add data export functionality

## Performance Considerations
- MongoDB queries are optimized with indexes
- Frontend uses efficient re-rendering
- Minimal dependencies for faster loading
- Responsive images and assets
